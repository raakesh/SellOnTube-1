# SellonTube SEO Rules Cheat Sheet

Read this before any SEO decision. These rules override general SEO defaults.

---

## URL Structure

- Hub page at `/section/` → children MUST be `/section/[slug]` (not `/section-[slug]`)
- YouTube For: `/youtube-for/[slug]` — e.g. `/youtube-for/coaches`
- YouTube Vs: `/youtube-vs/[slug]` — e.g. `/youtube-vs/facebook`
- Wildcard redirects in `netlify.toml` handle old flat URLs (`/youtube-for-:slug` → `/youtube-for/:slug`)
- Calculator page is `/youtube-roi-calculator` (NOT `/calculator` — 301 in place)
- No `/contact` page — booking link is `https://cal.com/gautham-8bdvdx/30min`

---

## Canonicals

- Every page must have an explicit `canonical` tag
- Blog posts: set in MDX frontmatter under `metadata.canonical`
- pSEO pages: rendered from `niches.ts` / `comparisons.ts` metaTitle/metaDescription fields
- Never let two URLs serve the same content without a canonical or 301

---

## Redirects (netlify.toml)

- All legacy WordPress URLs must have 301s: `/category/`, `/tag/`, `/author/`, `/homes/`, `/landing/`
- Check GSC Pages report for non-Astro URLs still getting impressions — add 301 for each
- `/calculator` → `/youtube-roi-calculator` (301, live)
- `/youtube-for-:slug` → `/youtube-for/:slug` (wildcard, live)
- `/youtube-vs-:slug` → `/youtube-vs/:slug` (wildcard, live)

---

## pSEO Rules

- 29 "YouTube For" niche pages + 20 "YouTube Vs" comparison pages
- publishDate is IST (UTC+5:30) — parsed with `'T00:00:00+05:30'` in 4 template files. Never revert.
- Drip rate: ~4 pSEO pages/week. Never suggest bulk publishing.
- Submit each new page to GSC (URL Inspection → Request Indexing) on publish day
- pSEO pages are NOT subject to the blog cadence rule

---

## Blog Cadence

- Hard max: 1 post/week. Ceiling: 2/week.
- Before scheduling any post: grep `publishDate` across `src/data/post/` and count posts in the same 7-day window
- If adding the post pushes any window above 2 — stop and flag to user

---

## Meta Titles

- Must NOT use the pattern "YouTube Marketing for [X] | SellOnTube" — too generic
- Must NOT open with filler: "The Hidden Power of...", "The Secret to...", "Why Most..."
- Must include a specific hook, outcome, or differentiator
- Keep under 65 characters where possible
- Include the primary keyword near the front

## Meta Descriptions

- Must NOT open with "Turn YouTube into a..." (generic across all pages)
- Must NOT open with "A breakdown of..." / "A practical guide..." / "This post covers..."
- Must include at least one specific claim, number, or contrast
- Target 150–160 characters
- No em-dashes (—)

---

## Title + Excerpt Checklist (blog posts)

Before approving or publishing any post, verify:
1. Title does not open with generic filler
2. Title does not use insider jargon the reader wouldn't search
3. Excerpt does not start with "A practical guide..." or "This post covers..."
4. Excerpt has at least one specific claim, number, or hook
5. Grep excerpt for broken em-dashes (hyphen surrounded by word chars with no spaces)

---

## GSC Legacy URL Triage

Two distinct cases — never give blanket advice:
1. **URLs with ranking equity** (impressions for relevant queries, position < 20): use GSC "Request Indexing" so Google crawls the 301 and passes equity to destination
2. **Junk pages** (WordPress artifacts, irrelevant queries, no SEO value): use GSC Removals tool to delete from index immediately

---

## Indexing

- New pSEO pages: submit to GSC on publish day (URL Inspection → Request Indexing)
- After any structural redirect change: request re-crawl of affected URLs
- Check sitemap is up to date and submitted in GSC

---

## Schema

- JSON-LD is in `src/components/common/JsonLd.astro`
- Blog posts should have Article schema
- FAQ sections should have FAQPage schema where present
- pSEO pages should have WebPage schema

---

## Technical

- Stack: Astro 5 (static), Tailwind, MDX, Netlify
- Partytown runs GA4 — use `window.dataLayer.push()`, NOT `transport_type: 'beacon'`
- Astro config: `astro.config.ts` — Partytown must have `forward: ['dataLayer.push']`
- Site config: `src/config.yaml`
- Netlify config: `netlify.toml`

---

## What Google Actually Uses (from official guide)

- Title tag + page headings → title link in SERP
- Meta description → snippet (you write it, Google may or may not use it)
- Alt text → image understanding
- Internal links → crawl discovery
- Canonical tag → duplicate content resolution
- robots.txt / noindex → crawl/index control
- Sitemaps → crawl coverage (optional but helpful)

## What Google Does NOT Use

- Keywords meta tag (ignored completely)
- Heading order for ranking (matters for accessibility, not ranking)
- Exact word count targets
- E-E-A-T as a direct ranking factor (it's a quality framework, not a signal)
- Keywords in domain name (minimal impact)
